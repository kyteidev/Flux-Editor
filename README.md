## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You can find built binaries in the [Releases](https://github.com/kyteidev/FluxEditor/releases) page. (NOTE: since I don't have a code-signing certificate yet, you may encounter a "unidentified developer" or "Windows protected your PC" popup. If you don't trust the builds, you can always build Flux Editor from source. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/kyteidev/FluxEditor/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions)
