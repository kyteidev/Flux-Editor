## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities are automatically checked every week. If found, they will be resolved as soon as possible. All dependencies are also updated every week.

To report a security vulnerability, you can go [here](https://github.com/kyteidev/FluxEditor/security/advisories/new) or send an email to fluxeditordevs@proton.me

Security vulnerability fixes are usually accepted, but if it's suspected to be a false positive or is just not important enough to spend hours fixing it, they may be ignored.

Security is a top priority in the development of Flux Editor. If you have any questions, create a new issue!
